## Organizing subfolders

It is recommended that subfolders be either organized by date and/or procedure. In case of a combination of, the folder name should start with the date.

When using date, the ISO8601 format should be used (i.e YYYY-MM-DD).
When using procedure, the names should be appropriately descriptive and formatted in an easily readable manner that allow it to be distinguished from other documents in the same subsection.

## Naming Files and Folders

1. Naming in General

Naming is hard. We know that. You want everything neat and tidy, but sometimes things just don't go that way - and that is perfectly fine.  **Don't be afraid to break the rules and adjust this tree to your needs.**

2. Technical Issues

Some systems simply do not allow certain characters, some others do not play nice with them.

Here is a small (and incomplete) list of characters you should avoid (AKA "Forbidden Characters")

- *Please use this list as a general rule of thumb.*
- *The List applies to all major operating systems.*

```
File Seperators:
: (colon)
/ (forward slash)
\ (backward slash aka "backslash")

Non-alphabetical and non-numerical symbols:
¢ (Cent Symbol)
™ (Trademark Symbol)
$ (Dollar-Sign)
® (Registered Trademark Symbol)

Punctuation marks, parentheses, quotation marks, brackets and operators:
< (less than)
> (greater than)
" (double quote)
' (single quote)
| (vertical bar or pipe)
? (question mark)
* (asterisk)

Other, rather technical "characters":
MultiSpace ("Foo.      Bar   .txt")
Tab
Newline
NUL (integer value zero)
Embedded Returns
```
